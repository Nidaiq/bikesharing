# Bikesharing

# Background:

Last summer I took a trip to the Big Apple (New York City) with my friend Kate.  Together we explored many historic landmarks like *Central Park*, *Statue of Liberty* and *Empire State Building*.  The reason we had so much fun in New York City was because we had biked everywhere and it was such an important part of our memorable trip. Kate and I thought about starting another bike business in our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa.  A few weeks later Kate called to tell me that there was an angel investor who would like to invest in our bikeshare business in Des Moines. Although the offer is very tempting, the mechanics of making things work in Des Moines maybe very different than that in New York City. I will be looking at the data for the bikeshare business.  I am starting with the data file for the month of August in 2019 for this analysis.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to find how the bikeshare program works in New York City and then figure out how it may work in Des Moines.  Factors like start locations, end locations, trip time, user type and gender breakdown could be used to make certain key analysis. This would allow us to evaluate if this could potentially be a successful venture.

# Results:

Various datasets including breakdown of gender-based data, subscriber data, duration of rental etc. were evaluated for more information.  

[Image 1](https://github.com/Nidaiq/bikesharing/blob/main/Image%201.png) Number of bikes vs. Tripduration (in hours and minutes) was plotted. The graph shows has been filtered for 0-2 hours.  The graph indicates one peak that shows that over 146K trips have been for approximately 5 mins. Trip duration has a min value of 1 minute and max value of approximately 50 minutes.

[Image 2](https://github.com/Nidaiq/bikesharing/blob/main/Image%202.png)shows the breakdown of the users based on gender.  The data reveals that users were mostly male.  Male users have used the bikes for approximately 5 mins and around 3 times more than female users for that same time of usage.

[Image 3](https://github.com/Nidaiq/bikesharing/blob/main/Image%203.png) shows the chart that is acheived by plotting weekday (stoptime) and start time as hours. The plot shows that during weekdays most trips were made in the morning around 8am or in the evening between 5-6pm.  During the weekends the data is equally spread out between 9am to 7pm.  Thursday is the busiest day with most trips followed by Friday.  

[Image 4](https://github.com/Nidaiq/bikesharing/blob/main/Image%204.png) shows images similar to image three but now separated based on gender information.  It is evident that most trips were made by men around 5-6pm on Thursday. 

[Image 5](https://github.com/Nidaiq/bikesharing/blob/main/Image%205.png) shows that most subscribers were male and used their subscription mostly either Thursday - Friday  as well as Monday- Tuesday.  Most female subscribers used the bikes equally over the 7 days of the week.

[Image 6](https://github.com/Nidaiq/bikesharing/blob/main/Image%206.png) shows that there are almost 5 times more subscribers that use the bike as compared to the customers.

[Image 7](https://github.com/Nidaiq/bikesharing/blob/main/Image%207.png) shows that there are almost 2.5 times more male users of the bikes than female users.

# Summary:
Looking at why this project had started in the first place it is evident that if the locations are picked carefully this could be a profitable venture as it is highly dependent on the number of subscribers that are using the bike for work.  Male subscribers are mostly using these bikes during weekdays to commute for 5-minute trips.  These trips are mostly carried out when commuters are going from home to work in the morning and then back home in the evening. The data also shows that bikes are rented for under an hour, so the start and stop stations are fixed, than their location should be very thought out for the success of the business.   Further research may be required to solidify if this is a good plan for a smaller city.

## Recommendations:
Some recommendations for more analysis are stated below:

- A line graph of birth year and user data would tell you the age of the users.  I turns out that most users were born  around 1970.  The second peak related to age is around users born in 1990.  This would make age of most users around 50 years old and the second age group in early twenties.  
[Image 8](https://github.com/Nidaiq/bikesharing/blob/main/Image%208.png) shows the graph acheived.

- A gradient chart of User type and Birth Year would reveal that most users born in 1970s are customers, vs the subscribers mostly fall between 1980 - 1995.
[Image 9](https://github.com/Nidaiq/bikesharing/blob/main/Image%209.png) shows these results.

- Further research should be done to see what is around the start locations and ending locations during peak hours. This would help create an understanding of the areas where the business idea could be successful. 

- Most younger individuals in New York City may not own cars and thus use bikes or public transport.  This data should be achieved for Des Moines to see if the business plan would translate towards a smaller city.

- More research is also required to see if this business plan is sustainable during the other 11 months of the year.
